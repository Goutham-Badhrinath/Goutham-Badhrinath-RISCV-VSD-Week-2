## 📑 What This Week Covers

### Part 1 – Conceptual Understanding (Theory)
**Introduction to System-on-Chip (SoC)**  

**Key components of a typical SoC:**
- **CPU** – the processing unit  
- **Memory** – instruction and data storage  
- **Peripherals** – external interfaces  
- **Interconnect** – the bus backbone connecting everything together  

**Why Baby SoC?**  
The Baby SoC is an ideal simplified model to learn SoC concepts without overwhelming complexity.

**Importance of Functional Modeling**  
Before jumping into RTL and physical design, functional modeling ensures the design is logically correct.

### Part 2 – Hands-on Labs on BabySoC
- Simulating the Baby SoC using **Icarus Verilog**
- Observing SoC behavior through **GTKWave**
- Simulation logs
- Capturing waveform screenshots and explaining their significance
- Explaining the calculations involved and the execution steps for the VSDBabySoC design

---

## 🎯 Research Goals
By the end of Week 2, the goals are to:
- Understand the building blocks of an SoC  
- Recognize the role of the Baby SoC in learning design fundamentals  
- Practice functional modeling to validate correctness early in the design cycle  
- Gain familiarity with simulation tools (**Icarus Verilog + GTKWave**)  

---

## ✅ Research Outcomes
- A clear explanation of SoC fundamentals  
- Successful functional simulation of the Baby SoC  
- GTKWave screenshots demonstrating correct SoC behavior  
- Concise explanations accompanying each result  

---

## 📝 Conclusion
- An SoC is more than just a CPU – it is the integration of CPU, memory, peripherals, and interconnect.  
- The Baby SoC provides a simplified way to understand and experiment with SoC design.  
- Functional modeling is essential before moving into RTL implementation and physical design.  
- Tools like **Icarus Verilog** and **GTKWave** are vital for early debugging and verification.
